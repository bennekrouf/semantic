prompts:
  find_endpoint:
    template: |
      Given this reference sentence: '{input_sentence}'
      Compare it to these possible actions and identify which one most closely matches the core intent and meaning of the reference sentence:
      {actions_list}
      Determine the closest match by:
      1. Identifying the main verb/action in the reference sentence
      2. Extracting key elements (who, what, when, where, why, how)
      3. Comparing these elements to the fundamental purpose of each action option
      4. Selecting the action that best captures the essential meaning and purpose

      IMPORTANT: Output only the exact text of the single best matching action from the list.
      DO NOT use any markdown formatting or code blocks.
      DO NOT add any additional text or explanations.
      DO NOT wrap the response in quotes or backticks.

  match_fields:
    template: |
      Map these input fields to endpoint parameters:
      Input fields: {input_fields}
      Available parameters:
      {parameters}
      Return only a JSON with parameter name as key and matched value as value.
      Use the alternatives list to find matching fields.
      Return only the parameters that have matching input fields.

  sentence_to_json:
    template: |
      Sentence: {sentence}

      Task: Generate a precise, minimal JSON structure based strictly on the sentence.

      Rules:
      1. Create an 'endpoints' array with exactly the details from the sentence.
      2. Each endpoint must have:
         - Precise 'description' matching the sentence
         - 'fields' object where EACH key has its EXACT value from the sentence
      3. Do NOT invent additional endpoints or fields
      4. Generate only plain field with its value and not a value a field value as field and a boolean nested in
      5. Use the EXACT values found in the sentence for each field
      6. Output ONLY the valid JSON without ANY introduction sentence like here is the json
      7. Output ONLY the valid JSON without ANY explanation after outputing the json

      Example input: 'Send email to Alice at alice@example.com'
      Example output:
      Raw JSON string: {
        "endpoints": [
          {
            "description": "Server Down",
            "fields": {
              "server": "production",
              "not_responding": true
            }
          }
        ]
      }

      Now for your sentence: {sentence}
